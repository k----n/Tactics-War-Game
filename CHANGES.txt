1) Added PT Boat Unit
   - created unit/pt_boat.py for a PT boat class
   - added 'pt_boat' unit to unit/__init__.py 
   - edited maps/island.lvl to include a couple of PT boat units

2) Added a Power-Up System
   - created a powerup folder in main directory
   - created powerup/base_power.py to contain BasePower function
   - created powerup/Health_PUP.py, powerup/Attack_PUP.py,
     powerup/Speed_PUP.py for a health, attack and speed power up
     respectively
     - each .py contains a subclass that inherits from the BasePower
       function, and a 'use' function in the subclass to modify unit
       stats according to power up
       - Health_PUP.py modifies unit health and redraws the unit
       - Speed_PUP.py increases a unit speed by 2
       - Attack_PUP.py increases a unit's damage ability by 2 except
         for "Transport" units
   - modified gui.py to import powerup classes and functions
   - modified load_level function in gui.py so that power ups can be
     loaded from maps (just like units)
   - modified draw function in gui.py so that power ups are drawn to
     the map (just like units)
   - modified update function in gui.py so that if a unit intersects
     a powerup after moving, the power up is used on the unit and
     deactivated
   - modified draw_bar function in gui.py so that a description of the
     power up is given on the right side of the screen when the mouse
     hovers over it
   - modified maps/island.lvl to include one each of the power ups
     - For example, add the following for power ups:

       POWER-UPS START
       Health-PUP X Y
       Speed-PUP X Y
       Attack-PUP X Y
       POWER-UPS END
       
       where X,Y are X and Y coordinates for the power up
